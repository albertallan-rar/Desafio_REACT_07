        <p className="pt-1 text-slate-300">An anthropologist visited an African village. He wanted to get to know their culture and find out what their core values were. As soon as he thought of a game for the children. He placed a basket of fruit near a tree. And he said the following to the children:</p>
        <h4 className="text-center text-2xl text-orange-400">– The first one to reach the tree will get the fruit basket.</h4>
        <p className="pt-2 text-slate-300">But when the man gave the signal to start running towards the basket, something unusual happened: the children held each other's hands and started to run together. When they arrived at the same time, everyone enjoyed the prize. They sat down and shared the fruits.</p>
        <p>The anthropologist asked them why they had done that, when only one could have kept the whole basket. One of the children replied:</p>
        <h4 className="pt-2 text-center text-2xl text-orange-400">– ‘Ubuntu’. How could one of us be happy if the rest were sad?</h4>
        <p className="pt-2 text-slate-300">The man was impressed by this little one's sensible answer. Ubuntu is an ancient African word that in Zulu and Xhosa culture means 'I am who I am because we are all'. It is a philosophy that consists of believing that by cooperating, harmony is achieved, since everyone's happiness is achieved.</p>
